Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

- ``build_existing_model``: Update the simulation control arguments to the `BuildExistingModel`_ measure.
  See :ref:`hpxml-build-existing-model-defaults` for current defaults.

  - ``simulation_control_timestep``: Value must be a divisor of 60. Units are minutes.
  - ``simulation_control_run_period_begin_month``: This numeric field should contain the starting month number (1 = January, 2 = February, etc.) for the annual run period desired.
  - ``simulation_control_run_period_begin_day_of_month``: This numeric field should contain the starting day of the starting month (must be valid for month) for the annual run period desired.
  - ``simulation_control_run_period_end_month``: This numeric field should contain the end month number (1 = January, 2 = February, etc.) for the annual run period desired.
  - ``simulation_control_run_period_end_day_of_month``: This numeric field should contain the ending day of the ending month (must be valid for month) for the annual run period desired.
  - ``simulation_control_run_period_calendar_year``: This numeric field should contain the calendar year that determines the start day of week. If you are running simulations using AMY weather files, the value entered for calendar year will not be used; it will be overridden by the actual year found in the AMY weather file.
  - ``add_component_loads``: If true, output the annual heating/cooling component loads. Using this comes with a small runtime performance penalty.

- ``emissions`` (optional): Add these arguments to the `BuildExistingModel`_ measure for performing emissions calculations.

  - ``scenario_name``: Name of the emissions scenario.
  - ``type``: Type of emission (e.g., CO2e, NOx, etc.).
  - ``elec_folder``: Folder of schedule files with hourly electricity emissions factors values. Units are kg/MWh. Folder path is relative to buildstock_directory's `resources`_ folder. File names must contain GEA region names.

  - ``detailed_filepath``: TSV file with electricity tariff path for each option of a chosen parameter (e.g., County). File may also contain all fixed charge / marginal rate / PV argument values. These will override any fixed charge / marginal rate / PV argument values specified in the YML file. Any blank fields will be defaulted. File path is relative to buildstock_directory's `resources`_ folder. Electricity tariff paths are relative to the parent folder of the ``detailed_filepath`` file.

  - ``pv_net_metering_annual_excess_sellback_rate``: Photovoltaic net metering annual excess sellback rate. Applies if compensation type is NetMetering.
  - ``pv_feed_in_tariff_rate``: Photovoltaic annual full/gross feed-in tariff rate. Applies if compensation type is FeedInTariff.
  - ``pv_monthly_grid_connection_fee_units``: Photovoltaic monthly grid connection fee units. Can be $ or $/kW.
  - ``pv_monthly_grid_connection_fee``: Photovoltaic monthly grid connection fee.

- ``measures`` (optional): Add these optional measures to the end of your workflow.

  - ``measure_dir_name``: Name of measure directory.
  - ``arguments``: map of key, value arguments to pass to the measure.

- ``simulation_output_report``: Update the arguments to the `ReportSimulationOutput`_ measure.
  See :ref:`hpxml-sim-output-report-defaults` for current defaults.

  - ``timeseries_frequency``: The frequency at which to report timeseries output data. Using 'none' will disable timeseries outputs. Valid choices are 'none', 'timestep', 'hourly', 'daily', and 'monthly'.
  - ``include_timeseries_total_consumptions``: Generates timeseries energy consumptions for the total building.
  - ``include_timeseries_fuel_consumptions``: Generates timeseries energy consumptions for each fuel type (in kBtu for fossil fuels and kWh for electricity).

  - ``include_timeseries_emissions``: Generates timeseries emissions (e.g., CO2). Requires the appropriate HPXML inputs to be specified.
  - ``include_timeseries_emission_fuels``: Generates timeseries emissions for each fuel type. Requires the appropriate HPXML inputs to be specified.
  - ``include_timeseries_emission_end_uses``: Generates timeseries emissions for each end use. Requires the appropriate HPXML inputs to be specified.
  - ``include_timeseries_hot_water_uses``: Generates timeseries hot water usages for each end use type (in gallons).

  - ``include_timeseries_component_loads``: Generates timeseries heating and cooling loads (in kBtu) disaggregated by component type (e.g., Walls, Windows, Infiltration, Ducts, etc.).
  - ``include_timeseries_unmet_hours``: Generates timeseries unmet hours for heating and cooling.
  - ``include_timeseries_zone_temperatures``: Generates timeseries average temperatures (in deg-F) for each space modeled (e.g., living space, attic, garage, basement, crawlspace, etc.). 
  - ``include_timeseries_airflows``: Generates timeseries airflow rates (in cfm) for infiltration, mechanical ventilation (including clothes dryer exhaust), natural ventilation, whole house fans.
  - ``include_timeseries_weather``: Generates timeseries weather file data including outdoor temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar.
  - ``include_timeseries_resilience``: Generates timeseries resilience outputs.
  - ``timeseries_timestamp_convention``: Determines whether timeseries timestamps use the start-of-timestep or end-of-timestep convention. Valid choices are 'start' and 'end'.
  - ``timeseries_num_decimal_places``: Allows overriding the default number of decimal places for timeseries output.
  - ``add_timeseries_dst_column``: Optionally add, in addition to the default local standard Time column, a local clock TimeDST column. Requires that daylight saving time is enabled.
  - ``add_timeseries_utc_column``: Optionally add, in addition to the default local standard Time column, a local clock TimeUTC column. If the time zone UTC offset is not provided in the HPXML file, the time zone in the EPW header will be used.
  - ``output_variables``: Optionally request EnergyPlus output variables. Do not include key values; by default all key values will be requested.

- ``reporting_measures`` (optional): A list of additional reporting measures to apply to the workflow.
  Any columns reported by these additional measures will be appended to the results csv.
  Note: For upgrade runs, do not add ``ApplyUpgrade`` to the list of reporting measures, doing so will cause run to fail prematurely.
  ``ApplyUpgrade`` is applied automatically when the ``upgrades`` key is supplied.

  - ``measure_dir_name``: Name of measure directory.
  - ``arguments``: map of key, value arguments to pass to the measure.

- ``server_directory_cleanup`` (optional): Optionally preserve or delete various simulation output files.
  These arguments are passed directly to the `ServerDirectoryCleanup`_ measure in resstock.
  Please refer to the measure arguments there to determine what to set them to in your config file.
  Note that the default behavior is to retain some files and remove others.
  See :ref:`hpxml-server-dir-cleanup-defaults` for current defaults.

- ``debug`` (optional): Optionally enable debug mode. Enabling debug
  mode will preserve all simulation input and output files, including but
  not limited to: in.osm, all EnergyPlus output files, and intermediate
  existing and upgraded files (e.g., OSWs and XMLs).
