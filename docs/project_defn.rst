Project Definition
------------------

Most of the project definition happens in a project folder in the
checked out copy of OpenStudio-BuildStock. However, for this library to
work, a separate project YAML file provides the details needed for the
batch run. An example file is in this repo as
``project_resstock_national.yml`` as shown below.

.. include:: ../project_resstock_national.yml
   :code: yaml

The next few paragraphs will describe each section of the file and what it does.

Reference the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First we tell it what project we're running with the following keys:

-  ``buildstock_directory``: The absolute (or relative to this YAML
   file) path of the `OpenStudio-BuildStock`_ repository.
-  ``project_directory``: The relative (to the ``buildstock_directory``)
   path of the project.

.. _OpenStudio-BuildStock: https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-BuildStock

Weather Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each batch of simulations depends on a number of weather files. These
are provided in a zip file. This can be done with **one** of the
following keys:

-  ``weather_files_url``: Where the zip file of weather files can be
   downloaded from
-  ``weather_files_path``: Where on this machine to find the zipped
   weather files. This can be absolute or relative (to this file)

Baseline simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Information about baseline simulations are listed under the
``baseline`` key.

-  ``n_datapoints``: The number of buildings to sample and run for the
   baseline case.
-  ``n_buildings_represented``: The number of buildings that this sample
   is meant to represent.
-  ``buildstock_csv``: Filepath of csv containing pre-defined building options to use in place of the sampling routine. The ``n_datapoints`` line must be commented out if applying this option. This can be absolute or relative (to this file).
-  ``skip_sims``: Include this key to control whether the set of baseline simulations are run. The default (i.e., when this key is not included) is to run all the baseline simulations. No results csv table with baseline characteristics will be provided when the baseline simulations are skipped.
- ``measures_to_ignore``: **ADVANCED FEATURE (USE WITH CAUTION--ADVANCED USERS/WORKFLOW DEVELOPERS ONLY)** to optionally not run one or more measures (specified as a list) that are referenced in the options_lookup.tsv but should be skipped during model creation. The measures are referenced by their directory name. This feature is currently only implemented for residential models constructed with the BuildExistingModel measure.

Residential Simulation Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the key ``residential_simulation_controls`` is in the project yaml file, the parameters to the
`ResidentialSimulationControls <https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-BuildStock/blob/master/measures/ResidentialSimulationControls/measure.xml>`_
measure will be modified from their defaults to what is specified there. The defaults are:

.. include:: ../buildstockbatch/workflow_generator/residential.py
   :code: python
   :start-after: res_sim_ctl_args = {
   :end-before: }


Upgrade Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the ``upgrades`` key is a list of upgrades to apply with the
following properties:

-  ``upgrade_name``: (required) The name that will be in the outputs for this
   upgrade scenario.
-  ``options``: A list of options to apply as part of this upgrade.

   -  ``option``: (required) The option to apply, in the format ``parameter|option`` which can be found in
      `options_lookup.tsv <https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-BuildStock/blob/master/resources/options_lookup.tsv>`_
      in `OpenStudio-BuildStock`_.
   -  ``apply_logic``: Logic that defines which buildings to apply the upgrade to. See
      :ref:`filtering-logic` for instructions.
   - ``costs``: A list of costs for the upgrade.
     Multiple costs can be entered and each is multiplied by a cost multiplier, described below.

        - ``value``: A cost for the measure, which will be multiplied by the multiplier.
        - ``multiplier``: The cost above is multiplied by this value, which is a function of the buiding.
          Since there can be multiple costs, this permits both fixed and variable costs for upgrades
          that depend on the properties of the baseline building.
          The multiplier needs to be from
          `this enumeration list in OpenStudio-BuildStock <https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-BuildStock/blob/master/measures/ApplyUpgrade/measure.rb#L71-L87>`_
          or from the list in your branch of that repo.
   - ``lifetime``: Lifetime in years of the upgrade.

- ``package_apply_logic``: (optional) The conditions under which this package of upgrades should be performed.
  See :ref:`filtering-logic`.
- ``reference_scenario``: (optional) The `upgrade_name` which should act as a reference to this upgrade to calculate
  savings. All this does is that reference_scenario show up as a column in results csvs alongside the upgrade name;
  Buildstockbatch will not do the savings calculation.

Simulation Annual Outputs Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include the ``simulation_output`` key to optionally include annual totals for end use subcategories (i.e., interior equipment broken out by end use) along with
the usual annual simulation results. This argument is passed directly into the
`SimulationOutputReport measure <https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-BuildStock/blob/master/measures/SimulationOutputReport/measure.xml>`_
in OpenStudio-BuildStock. Please refer to the measure argument there to determine what to set it to in your config file.
Note that this measure and presence of any arguments may be different depending on which version of OpenStudio-BuildStock you're using.
The best thing you can do is to verify that it works with what is in your branch.

Time Series Export Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include the ``timeseries_csv_export`` key to include hourly or subhourly results along with the usual
annual simulation results. These arguments are passed directly to the
`TimeseriesCSVExport measure <https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-BuildStock/blob/master/measures/TimeseriesCSVExport/measure.xml>`_
in OpenStudio-BuildStock. Please refer to the measure arguments there to determine what to set them to in your config file.
Note that this measure and arguments may be different depending on which version of OpenStudio-BuildStock you're using.
The best thing you can do is to verify that it works with what is in your branch.

Additional Reporting Measures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Include the ``reporting_measures`` key along with a list of reporting measure names to apply additional reporting measures (that require no arguments) to the workflow.
Any columns reported by these additional measures will be appended to the results csv.

Output Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``output_directory`` specifies where the outputs of the simulation should be stored.

Down Selecting the Sampling Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it is desirable to run a stock simulation of a subset of what is included in a project.
For instance one might want to run the simulation only in one climate region or for certain vintages.
However, it can be a considerable effort to create a new project. Adding the ``downselect`` key to
the project file permits a user to specify filters of what buildings should be simulated.

Downselecting can be performed in one of two ways: with and without resampling.
Downselecting with resampling samples twice, once to determine how much smaller the
set of sampled buildings becomes when it is filtered down and again with a larger sample so
the final set of sampled buildings is at or near the number specified in ``n_datapoints``.

Downselecting without resampling skips that step. In this case the total sampled buildings returned
will be the number left over after sampling the entire stock and then filtering down to the
buildings that meet the criteria. Unlike downselect with resampling, downselect without resampling can be used with
buildstock.csv too. So, instead of starting with a fresh set of samples and filtering them based on the dowselect logic,
the sampler starts with the buildstock.csv provided, and filters out the buildings using the downselect logic.

The downselect block works as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  downselect:
    resample: true
    logic:
      - Heating Fuel|Natural Gas
      - Location Region|CR02

For details on how to specify the filters, see :ref:`filtering-logic`.

.. _filtering-logic:

Filtering Logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several places where logic is applied to filter simulations by the option values.
This is done by specifying the parameter|option criteria you want to include or exclude along
with the appropriate logical operator. This is done in the YAML syntax as follows:

And
...

To include certain parameter option combinations, specify them in a list or by using the ``and`` key.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - Vintage|1950s
  - Location Region|CR02

.. code-block:: yaml

  and:
    - Vintage|1950s
    - Location Region|CR02

The above example would include buildings in climate region 2 built in the 1950s. A list, except for that inside an
``or`` block is always interpreted as ``and`` block.

Or
..

.. code-block:: yaml

  or:
    - Vintage|<1950
    - Vintage|1950s
    - Vintage|1960s

This example would include buildings built before 1970.

Not
...

.. code-block:: yaml

  not: Heating Fuel|Propane

This will select buildings that does not have Propane Fuel type.

.. code-block:: yaml

    not:
      - Vintage|1950s
      - Location Region|CR02

This will select buildings that are not both Vintage 1950s **and** in location region CR02. It should be noted that this
**will** select buildings of 1950s vintage provided they aren't in region CR02. It will also select buildings in
location CR02 provided they aren't of vintage 1950s. If only those buildings that are neither of Vintage 1950s nor in
region CR02 needs to be selected, the following logic should be used:

.. code-block:: yaml

      - not: Vintage|1950s
      - not: Location Region|CR02

or,

.. code-block:: yaml

      and:
        - not: Vintage|1950s
        - not: Location Region|CR02

or,

.. code-block:: yaml

    not:
      or:
        - Vintage|1950s
        - Location Region|CR02


Combining Logic
...............

These constructs can be combined to declare arbitrarily complex logic. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - or:
    - Vintage|<1950
    - Vintage|1950s
    - Vintage|1960s
  - not: Geometry Garage|3 Car
  - not: Geometry House Size|3500+
  - Geometry Stories|1

This will select homes that were built before 1970, don't have three car garages, are less
than 3500 sq.ft., and have only one storey.

Eagle Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the ``eagle`` key is a list of configuration for running the batch job on
the Eagle supercomputer.

*  ``n_jobs``: Number of eagle jobs to parallelize the simulation into
*  ``minutes_per_sim``: Maximum allocated simulation time in minutes
*  ``account``: Eagle allocation account to charge the job to
*  ``sampling``: Configuration for the sampling in eagle

    *  ``time``: Maximum time in minutes to allocate to sampling job

*  ``postprocessing``: Eagle configuration for the postprocessing step

    *  ``time``: Maximum time in minutes to allocate postprocessing job
    *  ``n_workers``: Number of eagle workers to parallelize the postprocessing job into

.. _aws-config:

AWS Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The top-level ``aws`` key is used to specify options for running the batch job
on the `AWS Batch <https://aws.amazon.com/batch/>`_ service.

.. note::

   Many of these options overlap with options specified in the
   :ref:`postprocessing` section. The options here take pecedence when running
   on AWS. In a future version we will break backwards compatibility in the
   config file and have more consistent options.

*  ``job_identifier``: A unique string that starts with an alphabetical character,
   is up to 10 characters long, and only has letters, numbers or underscore.
   This is used to name all the AWS service objects to be created and
   differentiate it from other jobs.
*  ``s3``: Configuration for project data storage on s3. When running on AWS,
   this overrides the s3 configuration in the :ref:`post-config-opts`.

    *  ``bucket``: The s3 bucket this project will use for simulation output and processed data storage.
    *  ``prefix``: The s3 prefix at which the data will be stored.

*  ``region``: The AWS region in which the batch will be run and data stored.
*  ``use_spot``: true or false. Defaults to false if missing. This tells the project
   to use the `Spot Market <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/>`_ for data
   simulations, which typically yields about 60-70% cost savings.
*  ``spot_bid_percent``: Percent of on-demand price you're willing to pay for
   your simulations. The batch will wait to run until the price drops below this
   level.
*  ``batch_array_size``: Number of concurrent simulations to run. Max: 10000.
*  ``notifications_email``: Email to notify you of simulation completion.
   You'll receive an email at the beginning where you'll need to accept the
   subscription to receive further notification emails.
*  ``emr``: Optional key to specify options for postprocessing using an EMR cluster. Generally the defaults should work fine.

    * ``master_instance_type``: The `instance type`_ to use for the EMR master node. Default: ``m5.xlarge``.
    * ``slave_instance_type``: The `instance type`_ to use for the EMR worker nodes. Default: ``r5.4xlarge``.
    * ``slave_instance_count``: The number of worker nodes to use. Same as ``eagle.postprocessing.n_workers``. 
      Increase this for a large dataset. Default: 2.
    * ``dask_worker_vcores``: The number of cores for each dask worker. Increase this if your dask workers are running out of memory. Default: 2.
*  ``job_environment``: Specifies the computing requirements for each simulation.

    * ``vcpus``: Number of CPUs needed. default: 1.
    * ``memory``: Amount of RAM memory needed for each simulation in MiB. default 1024. For large multifamily buildings
      this works better if set to 2048.


.. _instance type: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/


.. _postprocessing:

Postprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a batch of simulation completes, to analyze BuildStock results the
individual simulation results are aggregated in a postprocessing step as
follows:

1. The inputs and annual outputs of each simulation are gathered together into
   one table for each upgrade scenario. In older versions that ran on PAT, this
   was known as the ``results.csv``. This table is now made available in both
   csv and parquet format.
2. Time series results for each simulation are gathered and concatenated into
   fewer larger parquet files that are better suited for querying using big data
   analysis tools.

Uploading to AWS Athena
.......................

BuildStock results can optionally be uploaded to AWS for further analysis using
Athena. This process requires appropriate access to an AWS account to be
configured on your machine. You will need to set this up wherever you use buildstockbatch.
If you don't have
keys, consult your AWS administrator to get them set up.

.. _post-config-opts:

Postprocessing Configuration Options
....................................

.. warning::

   The ``region_name`` and ``s3`` info here are **ignored** when running ``buildstock_aws``.
   The configuration is defined in :ref:`aws-config`.

The configuration options for postprocessing and AWS upload are:

*  ``postprocessing``: postprocessing configuration

    *  ``aws``: configuration related to uploading to and managing data in amazon web services. For this to work, please
       `configure aws. <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration>`_
       Including this key will cause your datasets to be uploaded to AWS, omitting it will cause them not to be uploaded.

        *  ``region_name``: The name of the aws region to use for database creation and other services.
        *  ``s3``: Configurations for data upload to Amazon S3 data storage service.

            * ``bucket``: The s3 bucket into which the postprocessed data is to be uploaded to
            * ``prefix``: S3 prefix at which the data is to be uploaded. The complete path will become: ``s3://bucket/prefix/output_directory_name``

        *  ``athena``: configurations for Amazon Athena database creation. If this section is missing/commented-out, no
           Athena tables are created.

            *  ``glue_service_role``: The data in s3 is catalogued using Amazon Glue data crawler. An IAM role must be
               present for the user that grants rights to Glue crawler to read s3 and create database catalogue. The
               name of that IAM role must be provided here. Default is: "service-role/AWSGlueServiceRole-default".
               For help, consult the `AWS documentation for Glue Service Roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/create-an-iam-role.html>`_.
            *  ``database_name``: The name of the Athena database to which the data is to be placed. All tables in the database will be prefixed with the output directory name.
            *  ``max_crawling_time``: The maximum time in seconds to wait for the glue crawler to catalogue the data
               before aborting it.
