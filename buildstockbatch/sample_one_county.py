"""Runs the residental quota sampler for a single county+PUMA.

The residential quota downselect sampler can be used to do the same thing, but this script
is much faster, especially for more rural counties. To generate N buildings for a location that contains
0.01% of the national building stock, the downselect sampler creates ~10000*N buildings, then filters down to
those in the selected location. This script generates only the N buildings that are needed.

Usage:
    python3 sample_one_county.py --help

    python3 sample_one_county.py G1900030 G19001800 100,200 path/to/resstock path/to/output_dir

        - Generates two files where every building has county=G1900030 and PUMA=G19001800:
            path/to/output_dir/buildstock_G1900030_G19001800_100.csv with 100 samples
            path/to/output_dir/buildstock_G1900030_G19001800_200.csv with 200 samples

Methodology:
    This modifies the conditional probability distributions from the standard ResStock national project
    to create a sample limited to a single county+PUMA. (For example, the selected location may normally
    be used for 1% of buildings in a national sample, but we update it to get 100% of buildings while
    every other location gets 0%.)

    To do this, we modify two files:
    - ASHRAE IECC Climate Zone 2004.tsv
        - Make 100% of the samples fall into the climate zone of the selected location.
    - County and PUMA.tsv
        - Make 100% of samples (within the chosen climate zone) fall into the selected county + PUMA

    All other housing characteristics are downstream of these (or don't depend on them) and are unchanged.

Assumptions:
    This logic is only guaranteed to work for the current ResStock national project. Other changes
    to the dependencies between the variables can break it!

    In particular, this code assumes:
        - ASHRAE climate zone has no dependencies
        - County and PUMA depends only on the ASHRAE climate zone
        - Each County+PUMA fall entirely in one climate zone
